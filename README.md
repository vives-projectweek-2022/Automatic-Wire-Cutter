## PARTS

### Electronic implementation

We use the following steppermotor for the cablefeeder as well as for the motor that drives the pliers:

The microcontroller that is used in the project is a NUCLEO WB55RG:

### Mechanical design

The frame is made out of maker beams, the other mechanical parts are 3D-printed.

### Communication

The communication between the website and the NUCLEO is via Bluetooth Low Energy.

## Setup

To get this repository, go to a local file directory and execute the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vives-projectweek-2022/Automatic-Wire-Cutter.git
```

To compile the program on a NUCLEO use the following command:

```bash
conda activate mbed
mbed target detect
mbed compile -f --sterm --baudrate 115200
```
